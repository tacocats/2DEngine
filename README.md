This engine is written in java, while most tools for it are written in Python.  This engine uses Lightweight Java Game Library 3, which is Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics (OpenGL), audio (OpenAL) and parallel computing (OpenCL) applications. The tools use the Tkinter GUI library for Python.
